# Home Page Widgets

The Home Page has a series of widgets that provide a quick overview of the information that is important to the user as soon as they log in, or return to the Home Page.


## Widgets Customisation

The widgets can be customised to choose which ones are displayed and their positioning on the page. This facility is controlled by permissions and can be unique to each user.

In order to begin customising widgets the user has to click the **Customise** button in the title of the 'Home page'. Once clicked the screen enters the 'Customisation mode' for the widgets, which allows for the selection and positioning of the widgets. The title changes and a **Select Widgets** hyperlink appears alongside a **Save** and **Cancel** button.
